            I was walking along a path at a farm when I saw this cute calf. I
            had to get a picture of it, so I stepped closer to the fence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Little did I know that there was a nettle branch right next to it! I
            brushed it as I stepped back onto the path.
          </p>
          <p>
            Big mistake. It hurt a lot, and kind of ruined the day for me. I
            still had fun, though, and I think the picture was worth it.

            I have a <em>lot</em> of yarn projects ongoing. My main one right
            now is a baby blanket for a friend. The baby was born in September,
            so I should probably finish it sooner rather than later.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also working on a fingering-weight scarf. It's a really pretty
            color, about the shade of gingko leaves. It's taking forever, but
            slow and steady wins the race, right?
          </p>
          <p>
            Some other projects I've been working on are a skein of handspun
            yarn, a brioche stitch scarf, and some others I'm probably
            forgetting.

          <h3>9 DECEMBER 2022</h3>
          <p>
            My art right now is mainly digital. I use a couple of different
            programs for it. My main one is Krita, which is open source and
            built around painting. I've also messed around in Photoshop, but I
            don't like it as much for digital art.
          </p>
          <p>
            My graphics tablet is an XP-Pen Deco Pro SW. It's a good size and
            easy to take around.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I do traditional art, it's mainly small doodles in the margins
            of my class notes with a mechanical pencil. Sometimes I do sketch
            something in a cheap sketchbook or on printer paper, but it's
            usually nothing fancy.
